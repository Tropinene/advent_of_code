# advent_of_code
This repository contains my Python solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles.

The solutions do not optimize any given parameter: They are not the shortest possible solutions, they are not the fastest possible solutions (or we wouldn't be doing Python). They are also not the most readable solutions, and they are not always the first solutions I would come up with (as leaderboard rushing code tends to be full of eyesores). They're something like my own initial solutions, cleaned up, and when necessary infused with the genius of the people on the Reddit Solution Megathreads.
